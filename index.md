## HGIA Green Loan Portal

## Overview

green-loan-portal is a web application that we have created for the [GEM$ loan program](https://gems.hawaii.gov/). The application provides improvements to current processes that are all done by hand. Some more improvements include:

* User account creation to create new applications and save their application status
* Friendly web-based form for the GEM$ application
* Database querying of loan applicants for loan processors
* Roles for all parties involved in the application process
